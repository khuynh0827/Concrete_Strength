# Concrete Strength - Regression Analysis

This project uses I-Cheng Yeh’s data on “Concrete Compressive Strength” to analyze how various types and quantities of ingredients affect the durability of concrete.
Techniques used involve multi-linear regression analysis and F-statistics testing, including ANOVA, multi-covariate plots, and forward-backward stepwise regression.

[This project was completed for UCLA's STATS 101A Course - Introduction to Data Analysis and Regression.]
